            <p>I am a 21 year old student with a love for all aspects of <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>teaching others</strong>. I am currently pursuing my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of California, San Diego</strong> and am expected to graduate in 2018. In September 2018 I will be starting at <strong>LinkedIn</strong> in San Francisco, CA as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>.</p>

            <h1 class="intro-title2">Triton Engineering Student Council: 2016 Technical Initiatives</h1>
            <p>Throughout the 2016â€“17 school year I was involved in TESC (Triton Engineering Student Council) at UCSD. This is a student organization that exists to promote academic excellence, community involvement, and strong ethical values among the students of the Jacobs School of Engineering. TESC unites the engineering student organizations and sponsors events that benefit all engineering students. TESC works to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prepare students for, and connect them with, professional opportunities;</li>
              <li>Coordinate, and collaborate with, engineering student organizations;</li>
              <li>Create and maintain a vibrant community for engineering students; and</li>
              <li>Champion engineering and engineers in the school, community, and beyond.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My position was that of technical team lead, a position in which I provided technical solutions for our organization as well as the over 20 member organizations that fall under our purview. In my role, I lead development of our new website (<a href="tesc.ucsd.edu">tesc.ucsd.edu</a>) and associated sites, handled technical questions, and operated a 15 person development team dedicated to innovating in event creation, checkin, and analytics. Throughout the year I was able to work on these wide varieties of problems and create some interesting projects to help our organization grow out brand.</p>
            <p>The first main project was the development of our new website because the old one as pictured below was dated and was in desperate need of new functionality:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*waUfrgf1vmcLU2qA1QbX3Q.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">Old TESC Site</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This old site was incredibly problematic for a few reasons, it was written in Ruby on Rails with Haml templating meaning that without technical skills a user could not simply make edits to the site, and additionally the entire design was simply dated and reminiscent of a starter bootstrap website.</p>
            <p>With these issues in mind we selected Wordpress to be our new CMS and moved our domain off of an old Pentium 4 based server with 512MB of RAM to the UCSD Business-Ready servers that offered a virtualized environment with an 8-core Xeon Processor and 2GB of RAM, a huge upgrade from our previous server still coming to us at no cost due to our close partnership with the Jacobs School of Engineering.</p>
            <p>Next came the implementation of our site, we wanted something that looked simple and locked down portions of the functionality based on organization statuses to cater to our member organizations. After a few iterations we came up with this home page:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ibzGazejKqOQ9wiMADI8NA.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">Current TESC Site</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This layout provide a clear callout to sign up for our newsletter via MailChimp to better engage the engineering student body and provide a navigation menu with all the links important to students (i.e. events, news, and contact) as well as organizations (i.e. login to access member organization forms). With WordPress we got a much better CMS interface to deploy updates with limited web development experience and a much better means of creating SEO optimizations for our content using the well defined site structure. We did offload some portions of the site to other services however, MailChimp for mailing list management, Medium for blogging and news, and TypeForm for the complicated multistep forms throughout our site.</p>
            <p>Decaf or the Disciplines in Engineering Career Fair was another big project that had some technical challenges that mainly involved the development of a companies listing site and two event registration platforms for students and corporations. For the website we decided we wanted to have a simple interface single page with all the information regard the fair with a mobile compatible view for ease of use during the fair itself as shown below:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S7O46jBhFbPPsA75QOEdIA.png" style="width:100%">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">Mobile Decaf Site View</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The next part was down to event registration, as we are a nonprofit student organization every dollar counts towards putting on great events throughout the year so we needed to find the service with the lowest registration rates and processing fees for our corporate sponsors. This turned out to be a little known (at the time) service called EventZilla that offered a flat fee of 1 dollar per ticket and PayPal integration for a 2.7% credit card processing fee or checks mailed to us directly. Then for the students we needed a platform to generate tickets for those that had early access with a limitation placed only on those with select emails, a functionality provided by EventBrite. With EventBrite we were able to provide these tickets at no cost and get easy checkins through their mobile QR code reader application.</p>
            <p>One of the final projects I worked on before taking my Spring quarter off to work at VMWare was a simple chrome extension to make checking into our events simple and store that data using the schoolâ€™s database for student information with fine grained breakdowns of attendee demographics. Initially the school built application, pictured below, was meant to be used with ID scanners but at TESC we had much more reliable and quicker mag card readers that we wanted to enable use of.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>The source located <a href="https://github.com/sdsharma/sls-mag-card">here</a> uses reads input from the reader then formats it to a form usable by the web app and then autosubmits to allow for movement to the next attendee within seconds.</p>
            <p>Since my time at TESC there have been a lot more new projects as the needs of the organization continue to grow and diversify, so make sure to keep an eye out on the website, <a href="tesc.ucsd.edu">tesc.ucsd.edu</a>, for any updates that may come along.</p>
