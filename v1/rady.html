            <p>I am a 21 year old student with a love for all aspects of <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>teaching others</strong>. I am currently pursuing my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of California, San Diego</strong> and am expected to graduate in 2018. In September 2018 I will be starting at <strong>LinkedIn</strong> in San Francisco, CA as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>.</p>

            <h1 class="intro-title2">Rady School of Management: Site Redesign and Performance Gains</h1>
            <p>Since my sophomore year of college I have been working for the Rady School of Management as a web developer, working on a team of three to help in creating, revising, and maintaining webpages featured on the site. Initially the work mostly involved basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, managing pages via the Hannon Hill Cascade CMS and creating micro-sites for special events and eblasts to be sent out to the entire Rady mailing list. However, going into my junior year the main UCSD campus site underwent a massive redesign as pictured below, creating a more modern mission-aligned brand:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cPN3wqyqV-s0MqV4kHllQA.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">Old UCSD Site</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sjT8N4N7KYmt0ggGL39qEw.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">New UCSD Site</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When the brand new site was released we were still fairly busy maintaining our own content and it wasn’t until my junior started that we made a big push to realign our site to match the aesthetics provided by the main UCSD campus. However, as you can see below this would be no easy task due to the tremendous amount of content we had and the vast differences between the two UI’s:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8w32C8wIhqas-wEsZCwSNw.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">Old Rady Website</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So we got in contact with the UCSD campus team to get their templates, and ended up with only a skeleton of what they had without any of the implementation to be used in the Hannon Hill CMS environment. Thus began the multi-month long project of porting portions of the site using additional languages such as XSLT, Velocity, and VB and piece by piece and component by component we built a reusable set of templates in order to quickly port over most use cases within our site to the new design. Soon after we went live with the new site as pictured below:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sJ35-_HUiTR7j6CZ5XHmBQ.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">New Rady Website</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Other than the color scheme most things are very similar to the main UCSD campus site, but we added behavior such as scroll to the top, hide menu on scroll in mobile view, and a mobile submenu to accommodate for hidden right rail menus while in mobile view. Yet despite the close similarities we quickly noticed some performance issues, something that was easily noted on our site with a payload size of about 5MB and the main campus site with one of about 9MB.</p>
            <p>To solve these payload size issues I started with the basics of minifying JS and CSS files and compressing images. These simple tweaks brought the site down to around 3.5MB, but that in my view is still simply too large especially on mobile devices and among the international community that has slower internet speeds than America on average. The next tool I used was actually a new one called Chrome Coverage that analyzes the sources on a page to determine what is in use and what is not as shown below:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E1KlCzSHnX1oIfT0izmMew.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding:5px;">Chrome Coverage Tool</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Using this I was able to bring down the styles and JS files significantly in size and combine the many files into only a couple decreasing the required number of network requests, and bringing the total site size down to around 2.7MB. The problem is ideally we want the site to be under 1MB to be serving all internet connected communities well, so I began looking for some nontraditional potential space savers: icons and fonts. What I saw was that we were not using a classic web font as listed <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">here</a> but rather a font known as Brix Sans that was about 1.7MB in size and various icon packs like Font Awesome and Bootstrap Glyphicons of which only 5 or 6 of the 500+ icons were in use across the site. So to resolve this we replaced Brix Sans with Roboto (about 10KB in size) and used the <a href="https://icomoon.io/" target="_blank">IcoMoon</a> tool to merge icon libraries and trim them to only the ones in use.</p>
            <p>By the time this was all over we had a brand new site design in line with the main campus, a final site size of under 900KB, page render time of about 1 second, and a Google PageInsights score that was originally around 30 on desktop that had risen to about 80.</p>
